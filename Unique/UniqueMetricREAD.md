# Unique Metric #

## *__Introduction__*


In this folder, you'll find the general outline that explains the Unique_Perspective. This is mostly comprised of a Unique Metric that aims to influence the outcomes of AI models to represent something closer to AGI.

This project is experimental and many of the definitions will be subjective. It goes without saying that it is difficult to define things like "Intelligence", "Creativity", "True":

    Is it "True" "Intelligence" when an AI model learns patterns and can apply it, though not explicitly told, to find a solution to a problem? I would argue no. Pattern-recognition, while within itself is a skill, by itself is just a trained trait. If a computer model can recognize every pattern there had ever been, and can predict any pattern beyond that then I would argue it is skilled in a trait that makes up the overall definition of intelligence.

To be specific:
    if an AI model is somehow trained in every possible trait that makes up human intelligence, is it intelligent? I would once again argue no. While the processes before the test (whatever is used to assess all human intelligence and all AI intelligence) mean little, as the result is the same, I'm going to put forth the opinion that many things humans are intelligent in, or the traits we have regarding intelligence, came from unintelligent design. Separate religion from the conversation. Human beings are not "optimally" designed for our environment, and there are many things we ourselves can witness that suggest it wasn't the "best" option but it was the option that worked the best.

Relating this to my question, if all AI Intelligence, and All Human Intelligence were compared, the AI intelligence holds less weight as valid due to the fact it needed to be trained. Trained on data much more extensive than what is required for humans to Learn.

It doesn't take 3,000 data samples, two servers, and over a thousand epochs for a human child to learn to not touch a stove, to not play with fire or to not pull a dogs ear.
The argument could be made that years and years of Evolution would be similar to epochs. While this has validity, there are issues with considering one AI model comparable to the path the entire existence of the human race and beyond. To follow this path, we would need to create AI cells and let each epoch be a years time. We would need to mimick the principle processes of evolution and the end result would be an intelligent digital species capable of reproduction, learning on it's own. Some may posit that this argument is irrelevant but I disagree.
These arguments matter because to move forward with AI in a way that both is practical and useful, we need to know and have solid foundations in what we want to accomplish. What is our mail goal with AI? Where would we like to get? Why? How do we define it? This article attempts to do just that. I hope to provide reasonable explenations for this experiment and I hope they remain based, if not complete scientific logic, at least solid human understanding (which I will define).


Consider this file to be the Abstract, the rest of the research proposal will be placed, along with sources from research, inside the research proposal folder. There, you will find specifics on each model that is used within the project, as well as the definitions, experiment configurations, notes on what works and what doesn't, limitations and any other adjustments that could help or inform the computer science community and other curious parties.

This project will not be perfect but I hope, even if it turns out to be bad science, that it at least is useful and opens the door to better, more applicable methods that allow us, as a species, to move a little bit smarter in this realm.


# Unique Metric Explained

## Metric: Primary Role - LOG 1 VERSION 1

Now, to give an overview of what "Unique" may be.

__This is subject to change, so consider this to be Log one, Version one__

---

1: The fundamental purpose of Unique is to measure a specific quality: the balance between Creativity and Rationality in regards to a models response. Specific functions will calculate a "reasoning" path (in my case, these will be generated by Creative and Logic models) and it the resulting score will tell if the model oversimplified or overcomplicated it's "solution"
__(note: not all responses will qualify as a solution to a problem so " " is meant to denote: Y. The "solution", the "answer", "response", "output").__

---

## Influence: Loss Function - Log one, Version one

2: "Unique" by itself is not the loss function.

The score it produces may guide the training of the AI model, and therefore, will infuence the loss function results. The **Unique Principle** uses the score from the Unique Metric and generates a penalty for a models "answer" and that is added on to the loss function. If the models achieve the desired balance, which will be a range, the model is not given a penalty.

2.b: Consider the Unique Principle to be a Quantum Physics truth. A guiding principle that acts as a force. Touch fire, get burned. Don't touch fire, no burn. It places a boundary on the outer-bounds of what a model can and cannot conclude.

***Please, read the research proposal if this outline is confusing. The full scope of the project will not be named here.***

## Architect: Conceptual "Layer"

1: It is not a literal layer to be added inside of a neural networks sequential layers.

Instead, Unique is a module/principle that orchestrates and evaluates the interaction between 2 parameters set. In my experiment: Creativity and Rationality are the models of interest.


[Note]
Sentiment, Logic, Emotion, Reason.
There are many names with their own relevances and issues when applying to the scope of my experiment.
I find it easier to specify Creativity and Rationality as the parameters of interest, the variables of comparison and the frame of how I assess the results.

Emotion/sentiment and Reason/intelligence have implications that require further analysis of how they're "defined" or operationalized and measured.
Consider my model pairing to follow the framework of the right and left brain, respectively
[End Note]

2: In code, this could take many forms. As this document is written before the actual creation of the Unique Metric, this could become a custom loss function or maybe a separate module entirely.

## Outcome: Unique Perspective

If a model consistently performs well according to the "Unique Metric" (a balance between parameter 1 and parameter 2) then that model can be considered to have a "Unique Perspective"

[Note]
In the case of my experiment, the result would be a model that has learned to solve problems not just accurately, but with a "golden ratio" of grounded reason/logic and novel insight/sentiment.

# Final Thoughts

I hope this outline properly enlightens my experiment and the purpose/mentality that guides my decisions. If there is anything I haven't covered between this file and other documents/the research proposal, or if you have any questions or suggestions for a next-step, please don't hesitate to reach out.

This file outlines the expected result but much like anything with science, it's subject to grow and destined to change. Please refer to the research proposal folder if you want the experiment specifics, hypotheses, and other notable definitions, descriptions or important considerations.
